# WORDLE

- Implemented with the PyGame library in Python!
- Based on the New York Times Game, Wordle :)

HOW TO PLAY:
-
- Type a 5 letter word and click the 'enter' key
- Check the new tile colours:
    - If a tile is GREEN, the letter is in the right spot
    - If a tile is YELLOW, the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot
    - If a tile is GREY, the letter is not in the word
 - Continue guessing until you find the answer!
 - After you win or lose, you can choose to play again or not :)
